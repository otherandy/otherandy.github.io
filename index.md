# Hello!
I'm Andy. My main interests are code, [videogames](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/) and sleep.

I'm currently a Computer Science student at the Faculty of Sciences at UABC. In my free time I try to study as much as I can about new and old technologies in computing or whatever catches my interest.
